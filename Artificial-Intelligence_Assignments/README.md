## 📝 **Assignment Details**

- **Assignment 1: BFS and DFS Algorithms**  
  Implementation of Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search algorithms for graph traversal.

- **Assignment 2: A\* Search Algorithm with 8-Puzzle Problem**  
  Implementation of the A\* search algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle problem, demonstrating heuristic search.

- **Assignment 3: Greedy Search Algorithms**  
  Multiple greedy algorithm implementations including:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path  
  - Job Scheduling Problem  
  - Kruskal’s Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm  
  - Prim’s Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm  
  - Selection Sort

- **Assignment 4: N-Queen Problem**  
  Implementation of backtracking to solve the N-Queen problem, placing N queens on an N×N chessboard without attacking each other.

- **Assignment 5: ChatBot**  
  Development of a simple conversational agent (chatbot) using pattern matching and response generation.
