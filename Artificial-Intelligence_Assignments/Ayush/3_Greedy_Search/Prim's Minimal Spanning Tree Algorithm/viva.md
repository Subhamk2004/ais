Basic Concept Questions
Q1: What is a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?
Answer: A Minimum Spanning Tree is a subset of edges from a connected, undirected graph that connects all vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight, without forming any cycles. It's a spanning tree with minimum total weight.


Q2: What is Prim's algorithm and how does it differ from Kruskal's algorithm?
Answer: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a weighted undirected graph. It starts from a single vertex and grows the MST one vertex at a time.
Key differences from Kruskal's algorithm:

Prim's grows a single tree from a starting vertex, while Kruskal's maintains a forest of trees and merges them.
Prim's selects vertices based on minimum edge weight, while Kruskal's selects edges directly.
Prim's works better for dense graphs, while Kruskal's is typically better for sparse graphs.
Prim's uses priority queue or min-heap, while Kruskal's uses disjoint-set data structure.


Q3: What is the time complexity of Prim's algorithm in your implementation?
Answer: The time complexity of my implementation using adjacency list and priority queue is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. This is because:

Each vertex is inserted into the priority queue once: O(V log V)
Each edge is examined once: O(E log V)
The dominating term is O(E log V) since E can be larger than V.


Q4: How does Prim's algorithm ensure that no cycles are formed?
Answer: Prim's algorithm ensures no cycles by maintaining a set of vertices that are already included in the MST. It only considers edges that connect a vertex in the MST to a vertex that is not yet in the MST. Since we always add one endpoint that was previously not in the MST, we never create a cycle.


Q5: Is Prim's algorithm suitable for all types of graphs? Why or why not?
Answer: No, Prim's algorithm is not suitable for all types of graphs:

It works only on connected, undirected graphs (because a spanning tree requires the graph to be connected).
It doesn't work on directed graphs.
It's less efficient for sparse graphs compared to Kruskal's algorithm.
It requires all edges to have positive weights in most implementations.



Implementation Specific Questions


Q6: Explain the role of the priority queue in your implementation of Prim's algorithm.
Answer: In my implementation, the priority queue serves several crucial purposes:

It efficiently finds the edge with the minimum weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
The queue stores pairs of (weight, vertex) ordered by weight, which implements the greedy choice property of Prim's algorithm.
The C++ STL priority queue with a custom comparator (greater<pair<int, int>>) ensures that the top element is always the one with the minimum weight.
It reduces the time complexity from O(VÂ²) to O(E log V) compared to a naive implementation.


Q7: What is the purpose of the "inMST" array in your code?
Answer: The "inMST" array is a boolean array that keeps track of which vertices have already been included in the Minimum Spanning Tree. It serves two important purposes:

It prevents adding the same vertex to the MST multiple times.
It ensures that we don't form cycles by only considering edges that connect to vertices not yet in the MST.
When we process a vertex, we mark its corresponding entry in the inMST array as true.


Q8: How does your implementation handle disconnected graphs?
Answer: My implementation doesn't explicitly handle disconnected graphs. If the graph is disconnected, the algorithm will only find the MST of the connected component that contains the starting vertex (which is 0 in this implementation). The vertices in other components won't be reached, and the resulting tree won't span all vertices of the graph. To handle disconnected graphs properly, we would need to run Prim's algorithm once for each connected component.


Q9: Explain the significance of the "parent" array in your implementation.
Answer: The "parent" array is used to construct and represent the MST. For each vertex v, parent[v] stores the vertex u that connects v to the MST. In other words, the edge (parent[v], v) is part of the MST. This allows us to:

Reconstruct the entire MST after the algorithm completes.
Print all the edges that form the MST.
Calculate the total weight of the MST by summing the weights of these edges.
The parent array is initialized with -1 for all vertices, and the root vertex's parent remains -1.



Theoretical and Analytical Questions


Q11: Can Prim's algorithm find the MST in a graph with negative edge weights? Explain.
Answer: Yes, Prim's algorithm can correctly find the MST in a graph with negative edge weights. Unlike shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's, Prim's algorithm doesn't accumulate weights along paths, so negative weights don't create issues. The algorithm simply chooses the edge with the minimum weight at each step, regardless of whether that weight is positive or negative.


Q12: What will happen if we apply Prim's algorithm to a graph with duplicate edge weights?
Answer: Prim's algorithm will still correctly find an MST when there are duplicate edge weights. When multiple edges have the same minimum weight, the algorithm will select one of them based on the implementation's tie-breaking mechanism (often determined by the order in which edges are processed). This might lead to different but equally valid MSTs if multiple MSTs with the same total weight exist in the graph.


Q13: How is Prim's algorithm related to Dijkstra's algorithm?
Answer: Prim's algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm are similar in structure but solve different problems:

Both use a priority queue to greedily select the next vertex.
Both maintain a set of visited vertices.
Prim's finds the MST by minimizing the sum of edge weights, while Dijkstra's finds shortest paths from a source vertex.
In Prim's, the key value of a vertex represents the minimum weight edge connecting it to the MST. In Dijkstra's, it represents the shortest distance from the source.
Prim's works on undirected graphs, while Dijkstra's works on both directed and undirected graphs.
Dijkstra's doesn't work correctly with negative edge weights, but Prim's does.


Q14: How would you identify whether a graph has a unique MST or multiple possible MSTs?
Answer: A graph has a unique MST if and only if all edge weights are distinct. If there are edges with equal weights, the graph might have multiple MSTs with the same total weight.
To check programmatically:

Find the MST using Prim's algorithm.
For each edge in the MST, slightly increase its weight and recompute the MST.
If any of these new MSTs differ from the original, the original graph has multiple MSTs.
Alternatively, check if all edge weights in the graph are unique. If they are, the MST is unique.


Q15: What is the space complexity of your implementation of Prim's algorithm?
Answer: The space complexity of my implementation is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges:

Adjacency list: O(V + E) space
Priority queue: O(V) space in the worst case
Key array: O(V) space
Parent array: O(V) space
inMST array: O(V) space

In total, the space complexity is dominated by the adjacency list representation, which is O(V + E).



Application Questions

Q17: How is Prim's algorithm used in network design applications?
Answer: In network design applications, Prim's algorithm is used to:

Find the most cost-effective way to connect all nodes in a network (like cities, data centers, or network switches).
Minimize the total cable length or cost while ensuring all locations are connected.
Design efficient backbones for computer networks by minimizing the cost while maintaining connectivity.
Plan telecommunication networks with minimum installation costs.
Design power grid layouts to minimize transmission line costs while ensuring all areas receive power.


Q18: In the context of SPPU Data Structures and Algorithms course, how does Prim's algorithm relate to graph traversal techniques like BFS and DFS?
Answer: In the SPPU Data Structures and Algorithms course, Prim's algorithm relates to BFS and DFS in several ways:

All three are graph algorithms that visit every vertex in the graph.
Prim's algorithm is similar to BFS in that it grows a tree outward from a starting point, but uses edge weights to determine the next vertex instead of discovery order.
While BFS finds shortest paths in terms of number of edges and DFS explores as far as possible along branches, Prim's finds a tree with minimum total edge weight.
All three algorithms use marking techniques to keep track of visited vertices (inMST array in Prim's, visited array in BFS/DFS).
Prim's can be viewed as a modified BFS where the next vertex is chosen based on edge weight rather than discovery time.
