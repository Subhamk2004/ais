Assignment 1: Bitwise Operations in Cryptography (C++)
Theoretical Foundation

Bitwise operations form the cornerstone of many cryptographic algorithms and are fundamental to understanding low-level data manipulation in security systems. These operations work directly on the binary representation of data, offering efficient and mathematically predictable transformations.

The primary bitwise operations used in cryptography include:

    AND (&): Returns 1 if both corresponding bits are 1, otherwise returns 0
    OR (|): Returns 1 if at least one corresponding bit is 1, otherwise returns 0
    XOR (^): Returns 1 if exactly one of the corresponding bits is 1, otherwise returns 0
    NOT (~): Inverts all bits, changing 1s to 0s and vice versa

XOR is particularly significant in cryptography due to its unique mathematical properties:

    It's commutative: A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A
    It's associative: A ⊕ (B ⊕ C) = (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C
    A value XORed with itself produces zero: A ⊕ A = 0
    A value XORed with zero remains unchanged: A ⊕ 0 = A

These properties enable reversible encryption operations, forming the basis of stream ciphers and components of block ciphers like AES.
Implementation Analysis

In this assignment, the C++ implementation demonstrates two fundamental bitwise manipulations:

    AND with 127 (& 127): This operation ensures only the 7 least significant bits remain, effectively "masking" the 8th bit (clearing it to zero). In binary, 127 is represented as 01111111, so when ANDed with any ASCII character, it guarantees the most significant bit is always 0.
    XOR with 127 (^ 127): This flips all 7 least significant bits while leaving the 8th bit unchanged. Such an operation dramatically alters the character while maintaining a reversible transformation.

The implementation likely processes each character of a string individually, applying these transformations sequentially to demonstrate how simple bitwise operations can effectively obfuscate readable text.
Key Concepts for Viva

    Bit Manipulation: The process of applying algorithmic operations at the individual bit level.
    Masking: Using bitwise AND to selectively retain certain bits while clearing others.
    Bit Flipping: Using XOR to toggle specific bits within a binary value.
    Reversibility: How certain bitwise operations (like XOR) allow for perfect decryption without data loss.
    ASCII Character Set: Understanding how characters map to numerical values and their binary representation.
    Endianness: The order in which bytes are arranged in memory (big-endian vs. little-endian), which can affect bitwise operations in multi-byte processing.

Assignment 2: Columnar Transposition Cipher (C++)
Theoretical Foundation

The columnar transposition cipher belongs to the broader category of transposition ciphers, which achieve security through rearrangement rather than substitution of characters. Unlike substitution ciphers that replace characters with others, transposition ciphers maintain the original characters but shuffle their positions.

Columnar transposition specifically works by:

    Arranging the plaintext in rows forming a rectangular grid
    Reading off the ciphertext column by column according to a predetermined key
    The key typically determines the order in which columns are read

This cipher is historically significant and serves as an excellent introduction to the concept of permutation-based encryption. While simple by modern standards, it demonstrates the fundamental principle that security can be achieved through positional transformation alone.
Implementation Analysis

The C++ implementation demonstrates several important aspects of the columnar transposition cipher:

    Padding: The algorithm adds placeholder characters (typically underscores) to ensure the message fits perfectly into a rectangular grid. This is crucial for maintaining the structure of the matrix and ensures consistent encryption/decryption.
    Key-Based Column Ordering: The number of columns in the matrix is determined by a key, which affects both the dimensions of the grid and potentially the order in which columns are read.
    Matrix Transformation: During encryption, the plaintext is written row by row but read column by column according to the key sequence. During decryption, this process is reversed—the ciphertext is written column by column and read row by row.
    Computational Complexity: The algorithm demonstrates O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the message, making it computationally efficient even for large texts.

Key Concepts for Viva

    Transposition vs. Substitution: Understanding the fundamental difference between these two approaches to cryptography.
    Permutation: The mathematical concept of rearranging elements in a set.
    Key Space: The total number of possible keys for the cipher (related to factorial growth in more complex variants).
    Rail Fence Cipher: A related transposition cipher that writes the message in a zigzag pattern.
    Multiple Transpositions: How security can be enhanced by applying the transposition process multiple times.
    Cryptanalysis of Transposition Ciphers: Frequency analysis remains possible since character frequencies are preserved.
    Fractionation: Combining transposition with substitution for stronger encryption.

Assignment 3: DES (Java)
Theoretical Foundation

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) represents a milestone in the history of cryptography as one of the first widely-adopted standardized encryption algorithms. Developed in the 1970s and standardized by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), DES operates as a symmetric block cipher.

Key characteristics of DES include:

    Block size of 64 bits
    Key size of 56 bits (technically 64 bits with 8 parity bits)
    16 rounds of Feistel network operations
    Initial and final permutations (IP and FP)
    8 substitution boxes (S-boxes) that provide non-linearity

The algorithm's security relies on multiple rounds of substitution and permutation operations, creating what cryptographers call "confusion and diffusion." Despite its historical significance, DES is now considered insecure due to its small key size, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks.
Implementation Analysis

The Java implementation leverages the built-in cryptography framework (javax.crypto) to demonstrate DES encryption and decryption:

    Key Generation: The implementation likely creates a DES key using a KeyGenerator or SecretKeyFactory.
    Cipher Mode: Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode is used, which encrypts each block independently. While simple to implement, ECB is considered weak for production use as it does not hide data patterns effectively.
    Padding: PKCS5 padding is applied to ensure the plaintext fits into the 64-bit blocks required by DES.
    Encryption/Decryption Process: The code demonstrates the complete cycle of:
        Initializing the cipher in encryption mode
        Processing the plaintext "Namaste India"
        Initializing the cipher in decryption mode
        Recovering the original plaintext

Key Concepts for Viva

    Block Cipher Modes: ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR and their respective security implications.
    Differential Cryptanalysis: A technique developed largely to attack DES.
    DES Weaknesses: Key size limitations, complementation property, and weak keys.

Assignment 4: AES (Java)
Theoretical Foundation

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) emerged as the successor to DES following a rigorous selection process by NIST. Originally designed as Rijndael by Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, AES has become the de facto standard for symmetric encryption worldwide.

AES operates on fixed block sizes of 128 bits with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Unlike DES's Feistel structure, AES employs a substitution-permutation network architecture with operations organized in layers:

    SubBytes: Non-linear substitution using a predefined S-box
    ShiftRows: Transposition step where bytes are shifted systematically
    MixColumns: Mixing operation combining the four bytes in each column
    AddRoundKey: XOR operation with the round key

The number of rounds depends on the key size: 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 for 192-bit keys, and 14 for 256-bit keys. This iterative structure provides exceptional security through thorough mixing and confusion of the input data.
Implementation Analysis

The Java implementation demonstrates several key aspects of AES encryption:

    Explicit Key Definition: The code manually defines a 16-byte key (128 bits), showing how keys can be specified rather than randomly generated.
    ECB Mode: Like the DES example, this implementation uses Electronic Codebook mode, which encrypts each block independently. For production systems, more secure modes like CBC or GCM would be preferable.
    Base64 Encoding: The ciphertext is encoded in Base64 to represent binary data in ASCII format, making it suitable for storage or transmission in text-based systems.

Assignment 5: RSA (Java)
Theoretical Foundation

RSA (named after Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) represents a fundamental shift in cryptographic thinking as one of the first widely adopted asymmetric or public-key cryptosystems. Unlike symmetric algorithms that use the same key for encryption and decryption, RSA employs a mathematically linked key pair:

    A public key that can be freely distributed for encryption
    A private key that must be kept secret for decryption

The security of RSA rests on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. While multiplying two primes is computationally simple, finding the original primes given only their product is exponentially more difficult with increasing key size.

The RSA algorithm works through these key mathematical operations:

    Key generation involving prime number selection
    Modular exponentiation for encryption and decryption
    Application of Euler's theorem and properties of congruence

Implementation Analysis

The Java implementation demonstrates the core functionality of RSA using Java's security framework:

    Key Pair Generation: The code generates an RSA key pair with a specified key size (typically 2048 or 4096 bits for modern applications).
    Public/Private Key Extraction: The implementation separates the generated key pair into its public and private components.
    Encryption Process: The plaintext message is encrypted using the public key, creating ciphertext that can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.
    Decryption Process: The ciphertext is decrypted using the private key to recover the original plaintext.
    Potential Size Limitations: The implementation likely addresses RSA's limitation of only encrypting data smaller than the key size by either breaking the message into blocks or using hybrid encryption.

Assignment 6: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (HTML)
Theoretical Foundation

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol represents one of the most elegant solutions in cryptography, enabling two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel without any prior shared secret. Published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976, this protocol revolutionized cryptography and laid the groundwork for public-key systems.

The security of Diffie-Hellman relies on the computational difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem in finite fields. While it's easy to compute g^a mod p given g, a, and p, it's computationally infeasible to determine a given g^a mod p, g, and p when using sufficiently large numbers.

The protocol follows these steps:

    Alice and Bob agree on public parameters: a large prime p and a generator g
    Alice chooses a secret value a and sends g^a mod p to Bob
    Bob chooses a secret value b and sends g^b mod p to Alice
    Alice computes (g^b mod p)^a mod p = g^ab mod p
    Bob computes (g^a mod p)^b mod p = g^ab mod p
    Both now share the secret value g^ab mod p

Implementation Analysis

The HTML implementation likely provides a visual or interactive explanation of the Diffie-Hellman protocol:

    Visual Representation: The page probably includes diagrams showing the exchange of values between two parties.
    Color Mixing Analogy: Many Diffie-Hellman explanations use the analogy of mixing colors, which might be incorporated in the visualization.
    Step-by-Step Process: The implementation likely walks through each stage of the protocol, highlighting how the shared secret is derived.
    Interactive Elements: There may be form fields for entering values or buttons to step through the algorithm stages.

Assignment 7: MD5 Hashing (Java)
Theoretical Foundation

Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to produce a fixed-size 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. Hash functions are one-way mathematical operations that map data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size bit string, serving several critical purposes in information security:

    Data integrity verification: Ensuring data hasn't been altered
    Password storage: Storing password hashes instead of plaintext
    Digital signatures: Creating message digests for signing
    File identification: Generating unique fingerprints for files

The MD5 algorithm processes input in 512-bit blocks through a series of bit manipulations, modular additions, and non-linear functions. It uses four 32-bit registers initialized with specific constants and updates them through four rounds of operations, with each round performing 16 steps.

Despite its historical importance, MD5 is now considered cryptographically broken due to demonstrated collision vulnerabilities, where two different inputs can produce the same hash output.
Implementation Analysis

The Java implementation demonstrates the practical application of MD5 hashing:

    User Input Handling: The program likely prompts for text input via the console.
    MessageDigest Class Usage: Java's built-in cryptography package provides the MessageDigest class, which implements various hashing algorithms including MD5.
    Byte Processing: The input string is converted to bytes, processed by the MessageDigest instance, and returned as a raw byte array.
